must place all the files inside src/mai/java/com/meta/fb
anything Java outside of this cant be talked by spring

There are 2 ways to layer out the project
1.
use folders structure
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/controllers
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/services
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/routes
but here the controllers need to talk to any other e.g. fooController talks to fooServices so both
needs to be public(not good practise)

2.
layer out on basis of feature like src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/foo which contains
fooController, fooServices, fooOthers


create a new package inside main dir
OPTIONAL:
new class
declare vars
write contructor
create getter and setter
create hashCode and equals 
create otString
TO BE DONE:
new record
create vars inside it

create controller
could use @RequestMapping(path,reqtype)
or use GetMapping, PUtMapping, etc.

controllers are used for routing, repositories are used for controlling things

Some Life cycle methods of a bean
@POstConstruct --> is auto call after class is created in spring boot context/container; 

Databases:
h2 database with JDBC API implements (prev both are dependencies) an in memory database
create a schema (structure) of DB with name schema.sql
create test.mv.db in specified path

Dependency Injection means we will inject it in constructor and assign to one of the fields/variable

if a value is passed in constructor thats arguements but if a class is passed its DI, if a function is passed then thats a higher order function or callback concept

in data.sql

INSERT INTO Run(id,title,started_on,completed_on,miles,location)
VALUES(1,'Morning','2024-01-01 06:00:00','2024-01-01 07:00:00',5,'OUTDOOR');

TOPICS SKIPPED FOR WIRTING
PostgreSQL with Docker
Spring Data JDBC (provdes a way to call some functions to interact withdb, doesn`t needsto create any methods of your own)
RestClients (use to communicate with other service usually in a microservice environment)
tests
	
Spring Data JDBC provide CRUD functions that can be called directly in Run Controller without needs to be specified in Repository
There are also some out of the box specialized CRUD options like searchByLocation that are automatically present in Spring Data JDBC
these however needs to be just declared in respository and can be called in controller
List<Run> findByLocation(String location);

you can also do like 

@Query(and then define your own custom query here)
List<Run> findByLocation(String location);
or
@Query(and then define your own custom query here)
List<Run> customMethod(String location);


is restClient
either create every thing by yourself liken in UserRestCLient.java
or use builtin UserHttpClient (but have to specify it in main Application.java) and import in UserCOntroller.java

Tests are something done outside of the scope of spring
