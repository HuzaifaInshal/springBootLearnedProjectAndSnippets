must place all the files inside src/mai/java/com/meta/fb
anything Java outside of this cant be talked by spring

There are 2 ways to layer out the project
1.
use folders structure
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/controllers
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/services
src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/routes
but here the controllers need to talk to any other e.g. fooController talks to fooServices so both
needs to be public(not good practise)

2.
layer out on basis of feature like src/mai/java/com/meta/fb/foo which contains
fooController, fooServices, fooOthers


create a new package inside main dir
OPTIONAL:
new class
declare vars
write contructor
create getter and setter
create hashCode and equals 
create otString
TO BE DONE:
new record
create vars inside it

create controller
could use @RequestMapping(path,reqtype)
or use GetMapping, PUtMapping, etc.
